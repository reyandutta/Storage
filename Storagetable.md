Also give me all the best practices from all the 3 clouds. 

Remember this chat is about storage services. Don't deviate.

Here are the latest **best practices** for object storage services on **AWS S3**, **Google Cloud Storage**, and **Azure Blob Storage** as of 2025[1][2][3][4][5][6]:

## AWS S3 Best Practices
- Map and audit all buckets regularly[2].
- Block public access; restrict permissions to least-privilege[1].
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for deletions[1].
- Enable versioning for object recovery and compliance[7].
- Apply lifecycle management with size filters and duration rules[8].
- Monitor Storage Lens for performance and cost metrics[8].
- Encrypt data with SSE-KMS or SSE-S3[1].
- Review access policies and automate transitions to cost-effective classes[8].

## Google Cloud Storage Best Practices
- Use IAM for granular access controls[3].
- Avoid admin permissions or public buckets[3].
- Enable Audit Logs for data access activities[3].
- Apply lifecycle policies and automate data transitions[9][4].
- Set retention periods and use Bucket Lock for compliance[3].
- Use storage classes that fit data access frequency (Standard, Nearline, etc.)[9][4].
- Monitor configuration changes to prevent misconfiguration[3].

## Azure Blob Storage Best Practices
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) and Shared Access Signatures[6].
- Implement encryption in transit and at rest[6].
- Enable versioning and soft delete for data recovery[6].
- Automate lifecycle management for tier transitions and purging obsolete data[5][10].
- Monitor storage metrics and set alerts with Azure Monitor[5][6].
- Assess storage tiering regularly to allocate data economically[5].
- Use Storage Explorer for efficient management and automation[10].

These practices ensure security, cost efficiency, and operational resiliency for cloud storage services in 2025[1][3][5][6].

I want to go across the security features and like governance, what's there in governance, IAM, api security, resiliency, etc. 

All things are related to storage services for all 3 clouds.

Here are the essential security, governance, IAM, API security, and resiliency features for storage services across **AWS S3**, **Google Cloud Storage**, and **Azure Blob Storage**â€”latest as of 2025[1][2][3][4]:

## AWS S3
- **Governance:** Block Public Access, bucket versioning, object lock for regulatory hold, cross-region replication for disaster recovery, data classification and tagging[1][5].
- **IAM:** Granular IAM roles/policies, bucket policies, access points for application isolation, MFA delete, support for OIDC and SAML for enterprise federation[6][1].
- **API Security:** Supports VPC endpoints (private link), HTTPS-only traffic, request signing, pre-signed URLs for time-limited access[5].
- **Resiliency:** 11 nines durability, multi-region replication, automated backup and restore, monitoring with AWS CloudTrail and Macie for sensitive data tracking[5][7].

## Google Cloud Storage
- **Governance:** Bucket/billing audit logs, object lock for legal/retention hold, bucket-level public access prevention, resource hierarchy support[2].
- **IAM:** Fine-grained IAM policies (bucket/object), predefined roles, support for groups/service accounts, policy analyzer for visibility[2][8].
- **API Security:** Service perimeter (VPC SC), enforced TLS for API access, signed URLs with customizable expiration, CMEK and CSEK for data access via API[2].
- **Resiliency:** Global multi-region replication, automated key rotation, continuous monitoring, strong consistency for all operations[2].

## Azure Blob Storage
- **Governance:** Blob immutability policies, soft delete/undelete, retention/lock, audit logging, firewall rules, network access restrictions[3][4].
- **IAM:** Role-based access control (RBAC) with Azure Active Directory, Shared Access Signatures (SAS) for delegated permissions, granular policy assignment[3][4].
- **API Security:** Private endpoints for network isolation, SAS tokens for time-bound API permissions, encryption in transit, firewall and IP rules for API[3][9].
- **Resiliency:** Geo-redundant storage, automatic failover, point-in-time restore, versioning, integrated monitoring using Azure Security Center[3][4].

These capabilities keep cloud object storage secure, compliant, and resilient for modern workloads[1][2][3][4].
